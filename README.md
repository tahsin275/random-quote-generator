# random-quote-generator
 This project is part of the Treehouse Full-Stack Javascript techdegree. In this projects, I had to create an array of objects containing all the quotes, then randomly select a quote and display it on the web page. There is also a button which refresh the quotes and display another one from the quotes array.
