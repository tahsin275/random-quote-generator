# A Random Quote Generator

This project is part of the Treehouse Full-Stack Javascript techdegree.
In this projects, I had to create an array of objects containing all the quotes, then randomly select a quote from the array and displayed it on the web page. The quote will auto-refresh in every 10 seconds. There is also a button which will refresh the quote if the user clicks on it.
