# A Random Quote Generator

This project is part of the Treehouse Full-Stack Javascript tech degree. It's the very first project of this program. In this project, I had to create an array of objects containing all the quotes, then randomly select a quote and display it on the web page. The quote will auto-refresh every 10 seconds. There is also a button that refreshes the quotes if the user clicks on it and display another one from the quotes array.
I've implented some advance styling like the background color changes randomly with the quotes and also it will only select color with dark hue so that the contrast remains the same with the light text.
